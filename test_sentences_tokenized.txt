There were the tall hollyhocks beginning to flower and dazzle the eye with their __COLOR__pink__COLOR__ , __COLOR__white__COLOR__ , and __COLOR__yellow__COLOR__ ; there were the syringas and Guelder roses , all large and disorderly for want of trimming ; there were leafy walls of __COLOR__scarlet__COLOR__ beans and late peas ; there was a row of bushy filberts in one direction , and in another a huge apple-tree making a barren circle under its low-spreading boughs .
The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses , and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden , there came through the open door the heavy scent of the __COLOR__lilac__COLOR__ , or the more delicate perfume of the __COLOR__pink-flowering__COLOR__ thorn .
From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying , smoking , as was his custom , innumerable cigarettes , Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the __COLOR__honey-sweet__COLOR__ and __COLOR__honey-colored__COLOR__ blossoms of a __COLOR__laburnum__COLOR__ , whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs .
Her eyes had an outer ring of seeming __COLOR__black__COLOR__ , but in effect of __COLOR__deep_blue__COLOR__ and __COLOR__dark_gray__COLOR__ mixed ; this soft and broad circle of color sharply divided the subtle and tender __COLOR__white__COLOR__ , pale as pure milk , from an __COLOR__iris__COLOR__ which should have been __COLOR__hazel__COLOR__ or __COLOR__gray__COLOR__ , __COLOR__blue__COLOR__ or __COLOR__green__COLOR__ , but was instead a more delicate and significant shade of the color more common with beast or bird ; __COLOR__pure_gold__COLOR__ , without alloy or allay , like the __COLOR__yellowest__COLOR__ part of a clear flame ; such eyes as the greatest analyst of spirit and flesh that ever lived and spoke has noticed as proper to certain rare women , and has given for a perpetual and terrible memory to his Georgian girl .
George , the elder , exhibited an __COLOR__ebony-tipped__COLOR__ nose , surrounded by a narrow margin of __COLOR__pink__COLOR__ flesh , and a coat marked in random splotches approximating in color to __COLOR__white__COLOR__ and slaty __COLOR__gray__COLOR__ ; but the __COLOR__gray__COLOR__ , after years of sun and rain , had been scorched and washed out of the more prominent locks , leaving them of a __COLOR__reddish-brown__COLOR__ , as if the __COLOR__blue__COLOR__ component of the __COLOR__gray__COLOR__ had faded , like the __COLOR__indigo__COLOR__ from the same kind of color in Turner 's pictures .
By the outer margin of the Pit was an oval pond , and over it hung the attenuated skeleton of a __COLOR__chrome-yellow__COLOR__ moon which had only a few days to last  the morning star dogging her on the left hand .
He had already a high reputation in the district for his dyes , and he was bent on discovering some method by which he could reduce the expense of crimsons and scarlets .
But Mr. Poyser drove at no more than a walking pace , that there might be as little risk of jolting as possible on this warm day , and there was time to exchange greetings and remarks with the foot-passengers who were going the same way , specking the paths between the __COLOR__green__COLOR__ meadows and the __COLOR__golden__COLOR__ cornfields with bits of movable bright color  a __COLOR__scarlet__COLOR__ waistcoat to match the poppies that nodded a little too thickly among the corn , or a __COLOR__dark-blue__COLOR__ neckerchief with ends flaunting across a brand-new __COLOR__white__COLOR__ smock-frock .
I have a __COLOR__scarlet__COLOR__ cloak , but that is for the old woman who wins .
On a heap of those soft shavings a rough , __COLOR__gray__COLOR__ shepherd dog had made himself a pleasant bed , and was lying with his nose between his fore-paws , occasionally wrinkling his brows to cast a glance at the tallest of the five workmen , who was carving a shield in the centre of a wooden mantelpiece .
In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon , and justified his name ; but the __COLOR__jet-black__COLOR__ hair , made the more noticeable by its contrast with the light paper cap , and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked , prominent and mobile eyebrows , indicated a mixture of Celtic blood .
The thought of Dinah 's pale grave face and mild __COLOR__gray__COLOR__ eyes , which the sight of the gown and cap brought with it , made it a laughable surprise enough to see them replaced by Hetty 's round __COLOR__rosy__COLOR__ cheeks and coquettish dark eyes .
`` You would like those , Dorothea , '' said Celia , rather falteringly , beginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness , and also that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than __COLOR__purple__COLOR__ amethysts .
It was no great collection , but a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty , the finest that was obvious at first being a necklace of __COLOR__purple__COLOR__ amethysts set in exquisite __COLOR__gold__COLOR__ work , and a __COLOR__pearl__COLOR__ cross with five brilliants in it .
The bow-window looked down the avenue of limes ; the furniture was all of a faded __COLOR__blue__COLOR__ , and there were miniatures of ladies and gentlemen with powdered hair hanging in a group . A piece of tapestry over a door also showed a __COLOR__blue-green__COLOR__ world with a pale stag in it .
`` Ah , there 's better folks spend their money worse , '' said a firm-voiced dyer , whose __COLOR__crimson__COLOR__ hands looked out of keeping with his good-natured face .
These thoughts were like a drama to her , and made her eyes bright , and gave an attitude of suspense to her whole frame , though she was only looking out from the __COLOR__brown__COLOR__ library on to the turf and the __COLOR__bright_green__COLOR__ buds which stood in relief against the dark evergreens .
Having convinced herself that Mr. Casaubon was altogether right , she recovered her equanimity , and was an agreeable image of serene dignity when she came into the drawing-room in her __COLOR__silver-gray__COLOR__ dress—the simple lines of her __COLOR__dark-brown__COLOR__ hair parted over her brow and coiled massively behind , in keeping with the entire absence from her manner and expression of all search after mere effect .
They found Naumann painting industriously , but no model was present ; his pictures were advantageously arranged , and his own plain vivacious person set off by a __COLOR__dove-colored__COLOR__ blouse and a __COLOR__maroon__COLOR__ velvet cap , so that everything was as fortunate as if he had expected the beautiful young English lady exactly at that time .
He , for it was a man , turned his head slowly towards where I stood , and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking __COLOR__gray__COLOR__ eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows , said solemnly , and in a bass voice , `` Her size is small : what is her age ? ''
April advanced to May : a bright serene May it was ; days of __COLOR__blue__COLOR__ sky , placid sunshine , and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration .
And now vegetation matured with vigour ; Lowood shook loose its tresses ; it became all __COLOR__green__COLOR__ , all flowery ; its great elm , ash , and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life ; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses ; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows , and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants : I have seen their __COLOR__pale_gold__COLOR__ gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre .
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between the gay __COLOR__blue__COLOR__ chintz window curtains , showing papered walls and a carpeted floor , so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood , that my spirits __COLOR__rose__COLOR__ at the view .
With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the gay stores : he fixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant __COLOR__amethyst__COLOR__ dye , and a superb __COLOR__pink__COLOR__ satin .
I told him in a new series of whispers , that he might as well buy me a __COLOR__gold__COLOR__ gown and a __COLOR__silver__COLOR__ bonnet at once : I should certainly never venture to wear his choice .
With infinite difficulty , for he was stubborn as a stone , I persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober __COLOR__black__COLOR__ satin and __COLOR__pearl-gray__COLOR__ silk .

It was enough that in yonder closet , opposite my dressing-table , garments said to be hers had already displaced my __COLOR__black__COLOR__ stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet : for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment ; the __COLOR__pearl-colored__COLOR__ robe , the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau .
Leaning over the battlements and looking far down , I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map : the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the __COLOR__gray__COLOR__ base of the mansion ; the field , wide as a park , dotted with its ancient timber ; the wood , __COLOR__dun__COLOR__ and sere , divided by a path visibly overgrown , __COLOR__greener__COLOR__ with moss than the trees were with foliage ; the church at the gates , the road , the tranquil hills , all reposing in the autumn day’s sun ; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky , __COLOR__azure__COLOR__ , marbled with __COLOR__pearly_white__COLOR__ .
It told me of the __COLOR__alabaster__COLOR__ cave and __COLOR__silver__COLOR__ vale where we might live .
And I was placed there , by whom I don’t know : I was in no condition to note particulars ; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose , that he was within a yard of me , and that a spread of shot __COLOR__orange__COLOR__ and __COLOR__purple__COLOR__ silk pelisses and a cloud of __COLOR__silvery__COLOR__ plumage extended and waved below me .
This __COLOR__ruddy__COLOR__ shine issued from the great dining-room , whose two-leaved door stood open , and showed a genial fire in the grate , glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons , and revealing __COLOR__purple__COLOR__ draperies and polished furniture , in the most pleasant radiance .

A dress of __COLOR__rose-colored__COLOR__ satin , very short , and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered , replaced the __COLOR__brown__COLOR__ frock she had previously worn ; a wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead ; her feet were dressed in silk stockings and small __COLOR__white__COLOR__ satin sandals .
Underneath the hand , as though guarded by it , lay a huge jewel of __COLOR__ruby__COLOR__ ; a great stone of wondrous bigness , for the __COLOR__ruby__COLOR__ is in the main a small jewel .

A slow , steady light , growing more and more bright , and changing in color from __COLOR__blue__COLOR__ to __COLOR__crystal_white__COLOR__ .
The coffer still continued to glow ; from it began to steal a faint __COLOR__greenish__COLOR__ smoke .
Generally __COLOR__black__COLOR__ hair is a type of animal strength and seems as if some strong expression of the forces of a strong nature ; but in this case there could be no such thought .
And there he sits , munching and gnawing , and looking up at the great cross on the summit of St. Paul 's Cathedral , glittering above a red_and_violet-tinted cloud of smoke .
`` Why , George , '' returns Mrs. Bagnet , `` was always free with me , ma'am , and when he said at our house to my Woolwich that of all the things my Woolwich could have to think of when he grew to be a man , the comfortablest would be that he had never brought a sorrowful line into his mother 's face or turned a hair of her head __COLOR__gray__COLOR__ , then I felt sure , from his way , that something fresh had brought his own mother into his mind . I had often known him say to me , in past times , that he had behaved bad to her . ''
He is of a worthy presence , with his __COLOR__light-gray__COLOR__ hair and whiskers , his fine shirt-frill , his __COLOR__pure-white__COLOR__ waistcoat , and his __COLOR__blue__COLOR__ coat with bright buttons always buttoned .

On such an afternoon , if ever , the Lord High Chancellor ought to be sitting here—as here he is—with a foggy glory round his head , softly fenced in with __COLOR__crimson__COLOR__ cloth and curtains , addressed by a large advocate with great whiskers , a little voice , and an interminable brief , and outwardly directing his contemplation to the lantern in the roof , where he can see nothing but fog .

And how eagerly , with what a light heart , would Flavian have taken his place in the amphitheatre , among the youth of his own age ! with what an appetite for every detail of the entertainment , and its various accessories : the sunshine , filtered into soft __COLOR__gold__COLOR__ by the vela , with their serpentine patterning , spread over the more select part of the company ; the Vestal virgins , taking their privilege of seats near the empress Faustina , who sat there in a maze of __COLOR__double-colored__COLOR__ gems , changing , as she moved , like the waves of the sea ; the cool circle of __COLOR__shadow__COLOR__ , in which the wonderful toilets of the fashionable told so effectively around the blazing arena , covered again and again during the many hours ' show , with clean sand for the absorption of certain great __COLOR__red__COLOR__ patches there , by troops of __COLOR__white-shirted__COLOR__ boys , for whom the good-natured audience provided a scramble of nuts and small coin , flung to them over a trellis-work of __COLOR__silver-gilt__COLOR__ and __COLOR__amber__COLOR__ , precious gift of Nero , while a rain of flowers and perfume fell over themselves , as they paused between the parts of their long feast upon the spectacle of animal suffering .

A numerous train of yeomen , called in the language of the times retainers , who yearly received a livery coat and a small pension for their attendance on such solemn occasions , appeared in cassocks of __COLOR__blue__COLOR__ , bearing upon their arms the cognizance of the house of Boteler as a badge of their adherence .

__COLOR__gray-stoned__COLOR__ and __COLOR__dun-roofed__COLOR__ , it stood within hail of the Wessex border , and almost with the tip of one small toe within it , at the northernmost point of the crinkled line along which the leisurely Thames strokes the fields of that ancient kingdom .

He was born in the __COLOR__purple__COLOR__ , noble himself , and heir to the highest rank as well as one of the greatest fortunes of the country , already very rich , surrounded by all the temptations of luxury and pleasure ; and yet he devoted himself to work with the grinding energy of a young penniless barrister labouring for a penniless wife , and did so without any motive more selfish than that of being counted in the roll of the public servants of England .

Because , while I was painting it , Dorian Gray sat beside me .
You , Mr. Gray , you yourself , with your __COLOR__rose-red__COLOR__ youth and your __COLOR__rose-white__COLOR__ boyhood , you have had passions that have made you afraid , thoughts that have filled you with terror , day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame .
Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his face in the great cool __COLOR__lilac-blossoms__COLOR__ , feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine .

__COLOR__gold__COLOR__ hair , __COLOR__blue__COLOR__ eyes , and __COLOR__rose-red__COLOR__ lips—they all were there .
He went towards the little , __COLOR__pearl-colored__COLOR__ octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange Egyptian bees that wrought in __COLOR__silver__COLOR__ , and taking up the volume , flung himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves .
